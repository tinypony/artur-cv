          Responsible for the technical side of the cloudification of
          core products. My main task was to accumulate knowledge
          on public cloud providers, their offerings and the
          latest cloud technologies with the later intention to pass
          it forward to the teams who need it the most.
          I also help teams to deploy and test their products in
          public cloud as well as to redefine software architecture
          based on cloud best practices.

          release of the next version of the product.

          the development of a completely new product for
          real-time customer engagement that is currently getting
          traction among mobile operators
